# Descriptive-Statistics-using-Python

Welcome to the **"Descriptive Statistics using Python"** repository! This project offers a comprehensive guide to performing descriptive statistics using Python's popular libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **SciPy**. Descriptive statistics are essential for understanding data distributions, summarizing key metrics, and preparing data for further analysis, which is crucial for **data science**, **machine learning**, and **statistics**.

## Introduction

Descriptive statistics provide insights into the basic features of your data, offering a simple summary of the data's main characteristics. This repository focuses on how to compute **mean**, **median**, **mode**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, and other key metrics using Python. These statistics are fundamental for **exploratory data analysis** (EDA), allowing data scientists and analysts to better understand their datasets.

Whether you're working with large datasets or trying to interpret small samples, this repository will guide you through the most important descriptive statistics concepts and how to implement them in Python for real-world applications.

## Topics Covered

1. **Mean, Median, Mode**
   - Learn how to calculate central tendency metrics such as **mean**, **median**, and **mode**. Understand the significance of these measures and how they help in identifying the central point of a dataset.
   
2. **Variance and Standard Deviation**
   - Explore how to measure the spread of data using **variance** and **standard deviation**. These metrics are essential for understanding how data points deviate from the mean, which is key in fields like finance and quality control.

3. **Skewness and Kurtosis**
   - Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution, while kurtosis indicates the "tailedness" or extremity of the data points. This section covers how to compute both skewness and kurtosis using Python, helping you better understand data distribution characteristics.

4. **Quartiles and Percentiles**
   - Quartiles and percentiles help in understanding the distribution of data relative to specific thresholds. Learn how to compute and interpret these values to gain deeper insights into the spread and concentration of data.

## Why Descriptive Statistics is Important for Data Science

Descriptive statistics are crucial in **data science** and **machine learning** for summarizing data and providing insights before building models. They play a vital role in the following:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics help in understanding data structure, trends, and outliers, making it easier to prepare data for further analysis or modeling.
- **Data Summarization**: Descriptive statistics provide a summary of large datasets, simplifying complex data into meaningful metrics.
- **Data Quality Assessment**: These metrics help identify inconsistencies or anomalies in data, which can be corrected before applying machine learning algorithms.

Without a solid understanding of descriptive statistics, it's challenging to make informed decisions about how to handle or model data.
